# Technical Writing Portfolio

I'm a Technical Writer with many years of experience creating clear and user-friendly documentation for developers, users, and DevOps teams. I like making
complex things simpler to understand.

I've collaborated closely with engineers and product teams to produce comprehensive user guides and API documentation for large-scale systems. I'm particularly
drawn to open-source projects, where I've actively contributed and engaged with the community to enhance documentation quality.

This repository contains examples of my work and links to published documentation.
