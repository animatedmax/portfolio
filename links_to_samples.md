## Open Source
I am one of the primary contributors to the open source [Cloud Foundry documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/) and a contributor to the open source [Apache Geode 1.15 documentation](https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/115/about_geode.html).

## Commercial

Examples:

* [Overview of the Cluster Configuration Service](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/10.0/gf/configuring-cluster_config-gfsh_persist.html)
* [Installing the VMware Tanzu GemFire Session Management Extension](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire-Session-Management/1.0/gsm/install_session_management.html)

I've helped create hundreds of document for commercial content.

Recently, I was one of two writers assigned to the VMware Tanzu GemFire 10.0 release.
This was the first major release in over six years and required close collaboration with
developers and product managers to edit, update, and revise over 1000 content files over
a three-month period.

GemFire is a high-speed, in-memory database used by large organizations for its high
performance, scalability, event notification, and fault tolerance for low-latency,
high-throughput applications.

For these samples, developers and product managers provided:

* Links to engineering tickets in JIRA that pointed to code changes, design documents, and developer discussions
* Access to beta products for the writers to explore
* A diagram they wanted included in the published documentation
* Draft reviews
* Answers and additional explanations through Slack messaging
